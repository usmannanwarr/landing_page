							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Recent graduate from the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Science with a 
								bachelor’s degree in computer science, specializing in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, 
								and Data Analytics. My final year project focused on developing a robust computer vision 
								architecture for the fast and accurate detection of small objects. I possess extensive 
								experience and knowledge in ML/AI and computer vision, alongside a strong proficiency in 
								data analytics and its associated tools and languages. Passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.
								<br><br>Currently authoring a research paper on the model developed for my final year project, 
								which achieved significant improvements in accuracy and inference speeds for real-time 
								detection of small objects like drones of diminishing sizes. The model maintained a 
								minimum inference speed of 30 fps, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for 
								practical applications in real-time environments..</p>
